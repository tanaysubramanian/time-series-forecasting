# Time Series Forecasting

In this project, I tested various smoothing models (moving average, simple exponential, Holt's Linear, Holt-Winters) to determine which model best visualized and forecasted data. The models were evaluated by how well they smoothed out irregular roughness and how well they retained the trend and/or seasonality of the data. Using  machine learning, I analyzed data concerning the number of visits to a specific Udemy website over time.
